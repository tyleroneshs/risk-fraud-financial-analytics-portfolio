# Risk & Fraud Financial Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a project-based portfolio demonstrating how I analyze
transaction-level data, review alerts, and make risk-based decisions in fraud,
financial crime, AML and KYC contexts using Excel-driven analysis and regulator-safe 
investigation rationales.

This portfolio is designed to reflect real-world analyst workflows — focusing on
judgment, consistency, and false-positive reduction rather than academic modeling
or dashboards.

## What This Portfolio Demonstrates

- Transaction monitoring and alert review workflows
- Judgment-based escalation vs. clearance decisions
- Excel-driven risk analysis and pattern detection
- Consistent analyst decision logic to reduce alert fatigue
- Regulator-safe documentation aligned with AML/KYC expectations
- False-positive reduction without sacrificing risk coverage  

## Technical Highlights (Excel)

- Logic-based risk rules using `IF`, `AND`, `OR`
- Lookup-based risk mapping using `XLOOKUP` / `VLOOKUP`
- Pivot Tables for transaction aggregation and pattern analysis
- Data validation to standardize analyst decisions and support QC review

## Case Structure 

Each case follows an operations-first investigation structure aligned with bank compliance workflows.

1. Raw transaction or customer data (Excel / CSV)
2. Risk indicators and alert logic
3. Analyst review and decision (Clear / Monitor / Escalate)
4. Written rationale designed to be audit- and regulator-safe
